# Project Log

This was my code assessment performed for Indeed as part of the interview process for the UX Developer role in Summer 2021

I started with the idea to change up the requirement for falling dots to be rising bubbles tha you would pop. That lead to the idea of putting pop song lyrics into the bubbles. Instead of determining the bubble size randomly, I will size them to fit the words. Longer words make bigger bubbles, and vice-versa. Different levels of the game will have bubbles rising at different speeds and can be associated with different types of soda, e.g. cola, lemon-lime, grape, root beer, etc.

## Notes
    "Dots should vary randomly in size from 10px in diameter to 100px in diameter."
- 10 px is way too small for a mobile tap target!
